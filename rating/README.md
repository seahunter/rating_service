Hi, everyone. This is my test Rating Service on Laravel.

## Running the project
1) You may create and database. I'm using a MYSQL with such params for this one:
    1) DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
    2) DB_PORT=3306
    3) DB_DATABASE=rating
    4) DB_USERNAME=root
    5) DB_PASSWORD=root
You can edit that on as you wish in file: .env

2) You may run a laravel migration, inside a project dir run command: php artisan migrate
3) Start a local webserver: php artisan serve
4) Open serve link.
